Square Matrix Project


This project implements a square matrix class (SquareMat) in C++. It includes functionalities such as matrix multiplication, element access, and more. The project also contains unit tests using the doctest framework to ensure correctness.
Requirements

    C++11 compatible compiler (e.g., clang++ or g++)

    make utility

    Valgrind (optional, for memory leak detection)

Project Structure

    SquareMat.hpp and SquareMat.cpp: Implementation of the SquareMat class.

    main.cpp: Demonstration of SquareMat usage.

    test: Directory containing unit tests.

    Makefile: Build and test automation.

Build and Run Instructions
Compile the Project

To compile the main demonstration program:

    make Main

This will generate an executable named main.
Run the Demonstration

After compiling, run the program with:

    ./main

Run Unit Tests

To compile and run the unit tests:

    make test

This will execute all tests located in the test/ directory.
Check for Memory Leaks

To run the unit tests under Valgrind for memory leak detection:

    make valgrind

Ensure Valgrind is installed on your system before running this command.
Clean Build Files

To remove compiled objects and executables:

    make clean

Notes

    The Makefile is configured to handle compilation, testing, and memory checks.

    Ensure that all dependencies are installed and accessible in your system's PATH.
